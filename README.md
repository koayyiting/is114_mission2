# Overview of Our Project
This is our project which is designed based on a topic given which is "Possible Theme 5: Propose Your own.".We decide to work on a pet adoption website. Why we decided to work on this topic is to help the abandon pets to get a nice place to live in. This website will include Home, Adopt, Donate, Event, Contact Page.

Our Goal is create a interactive and user friendly website.

## Design Process
Our Design Process for this website is to let users to be able to use the website easily. We decided to go for the default fonts size, not too big or small to make the website neater and users to read the website confortably. We will also design our website in a way that our information will be easily understood by the user (eg. Adoption Process). Our project will include navigation tabs to navigate to different pages, some front-end interactivity, organized and well structured information in the pages as well as suitable typography and color schemes. 

Users we also be able to visit our website on their phones. (not sure, if got time)

- As a user type, I want to be able to switch between pages with the navigation buttons.
- As a user type, I want to be able to enter messages and information in the contact us page to contact the owner
- As a user type, I want to be able press in "Learn More" buttons in the Adopt page so I can learn more 
  information about the cat.
